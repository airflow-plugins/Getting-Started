# Getting Started with Airflow Plugins

## Table of Contents
A full list of available plugins can be found [here](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Getting-Started/blob/master/table-of-contents.md).
Generally one repo is made per plugin with related operators and hooks are grouped together in one plugin when possible.

## Hello, World.
A simple tutorial teaching the step-by-step process of building your first hook and operator is coming soon. For now, please refer to the official documentation.

## Contributions
If you have a plugin that you've built or nefariously acquired (no judgement), we'd be more than happy to have it added to the org. General guidelines for how to get your plugin into shape can be found [here](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Getting-Started/blob/master/Contributing/contribution-guidelines.md).

## Example DAGs
All example DAGs that use the plugins can be found in the [Example Airflow DAGs](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Example-Airflow-DAGs) repo.

## License
Unless otherwise specified, everything in the airflow-plugins org is by default licensed under Apache 2.0. This was chosen to follow suit with the core Apache Airflow project.
