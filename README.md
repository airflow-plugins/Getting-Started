# Getting Started with Airflow Plugins

## Table of Contents
A full list of available plugins can be found [here](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Getting-Started/blob/master/table-of-contents.md).
Generally one repo is made per plugin with related operators and hooks are grouped together in one plugin when possible.

## Hello, World.
Tutorials can be found in the `Tutorials` folder. Example tutorials currently available include:
- [Creating a Hook](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Getting-Started/blob/master/Tutorial/creating-hook.md)
- [Creating an Operator](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Getting-Started/blob/master/Tutorial/creating-operator.md)
- [Adding UI Modifications](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Getting-Started/blob/master/Tutorial/creating-ui-modification.md)
## Contributions
If you have a plugin that you've built or nefariously acquired (no judgement), we'd be more than happy to have it added to the org. General guidelines for how to get your plugin into shape can be found [here](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Getting-Started/blob/master/Contributing/contribution-guidelines.md).

## Example DAGs
All example DAGs that use the plugins can be found in the [Example Airflow DAGs](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/Example-Airflow-DAGs) repo.
